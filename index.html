                <p>
                    Nso’ is a word that refers to both a people and a Fondom. According to oral history, the Nso’ people
                    migrated from Tikari in the north of Cameroon following a bloody conflict over succession after the
                    death of King Tinki in the late 1300s. Ngonnso’, the founder of the Nso’ dynasty, along with two of
                    her brothers, Nchare Yen and Mbombam, and their respective followers, left their father's clan.
                    Ngonnso’ and her brothers later parted ways and settled in a place called Mbo’nso’. Subsequently,
                    they moved to Ndzennso’, Kovifem, Taavisa, back to Kovifem, and then to Kimbo, presently called
                    Kumbo. The tribe was named after their esteemed leader, Ngonnso’. This is one of the most organized
                    and largest tribes in the Grassfields and Cameroon in general. They are essentially a race of
                    warriors and engaged in wars with almost all their neighbors except for those of Babungo and
                    adjoining Bikom. The Nsungnin seem to have followed the Nso from Banyo and taken up a position in
                    the hilly country to the north. Nso’ also played an important role in resisting German colonial
                    rule.

                <h2> THE FON AND HIS ADMINISTRATION</h2>
                <figure>

                <figcaption><em>Fon Sehm Mbinglo I. Paramount Fon of Nso </em></figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    The Fon is the traditional ruler and serves as both the head of the traditional government and the
                    chief religious authority, responsible for appeasing the ancestors. He is supported by seven
                    notables known as Vibais, who are Shufais with positions rooted in complex history. These include
                    Shufai Ndzendzev <em>Traditional Prime minister</em>, Tahnkum, Doh, Ruun, Tsenlah, Lun, and Yuwar.
                    Over the years, other Shufais have
                    been appointed by the Fon of Nso, although they hold lesser positions in the palace hierarchy
                    without significant political influence. The Fon's power is balanced by regulatory groups such as
                    the Nwerong, which acts as the government's security arm and enforces the Fon's
                    decisions. The Nwerong is exclusively responsible for enthroning a new Fon and replacing Fais and
                    Shufais after their deaths. Members of the royal families, except for the Fons, are not permitted to
                    join the Nwerong. The Ngiri, similar to the Nwerong, is reserved only for princes. New Fons are
                    chosen from a pool of eligible princes through a secretive process, preventing potential corruption.

                <h2> CULTURE AND TRADITION</h2>
                <figure>

                <p>
                    Masqerades, play an integral part in the culture and tradition of the Nso people.
                    Masqerades display on important ceremonies especially funerals and cleansing ceremonies and hail
                    from both the <em>Ngwerong</em> and <em>Ngiri</em> sanctums.
                    They may sometimes be refered to by the locals as <em>Shiv</em>
                    The <em>Mfu' or Njong</em> is another interesting group made up of warriors. Each village has
                    <em>Njong</em> hall where members gather every <em>eighth day</em>the <em>traditional week</em>. The
                    Njong hall is a
                    place for village men exhange information and plan the development of their communities.
                    These halls are masterpieces of craft with carved wooden piles.
                    organize communal work. Mfu houses are often richly decorated with carved posts inside
                    and outside.
                    <br>
                    Nso culture is showcased during funerals and the cultural week festival <em>Ngam
                        Ngonso</em> which assemles the various aspects of Nso tradition. Jujus are
                    prominentlydisplayed from the heitage sites and the palace to other parts of Kimbo, giving first
                    hand experience to both foreighners and Nso’ people.
