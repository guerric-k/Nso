                    <p>
                        Nso’ is a word that refers to both a people and a Fondom. According to oral history, the Nso’
                        people
                        migrated from Tikari in the north of Cameroon following a bloody conflict over succession after
                        the
                        death of King Tinki in the late 1300s. Ngonnso’, the founder of the Nso’ dynasty, along with two
                        of
                        her brothers, Nchare Yen and Mbombam, and their respective followers, left their father's clan.
                        Ngonnso’ and her brothers later parted ways and settled in a place called Mbo’nso’.
                        Subsequently,
                        they moved to Ndzennso’, Kovifem, Taavisa, back to Kovifem, and then to Kimbo, presently called
                        Kumbo. The tribe was named after their esteemed leader, Ngonnso’. This is one of the most
                        organized
                        and largest tribes in the Grassfields and Cameroon in general. They are essentially a race of
                        warriors and engaged in wars with almost all their neighbors except for those of Babungo and
                        adjoining Bikom. The Nsungnin seem to have followed the Nso from Banyo and taken up a position
                        in
                        the hilly country to the north. Nso’ also played an important role in resisting German colonial
                        rule.

                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        The Fon is the traditional ruler and serves as both the head of the traditional government and
                        the
                        chief religious authority, responsible for appeasing the ancestors. He is supported by seven
                        notables known as Vibais, who are Shufais with positions rooted in complex history. These
                        include
                        Shufai Ndzendzev <em>Traditional Prime minister</em>, Tahnkum, Doh, Ruun, Tsenlah, Lun, and
                        Yuwar.
                        Over the years, other Shufais have
                        been appointed by the Fon of Nso, although they hold lesser positions in the palace hierarchy
                        without significant political influence. The Fon's power is balanced by regulatory groups such
                        as
                        the Nwerong, which acts as the government's security arm and enforces the Fon's
                        decisions. The Nwerong is exclusively responsible for enthroning a new Fon and replacing Fais
                        and
                        Shufais after their deaths. Members of the royal families, except for the Fons, are not
                        permitted to
                        join the Nwerong. The Ngiri, similar to the Nwerong, is reserved only for princes. New Fons are
                        chosen from a pool of eligible princes through a secretive process, preventing potential
                        corruption.

                        <p> A paper <em> Published by: B. CHEM-LANGHËË, VERKIJIKA G. FANSO and E.M. CHILVER
                            </em> establishes the following:

                            with later, can come to <em> ngwerong la'</em>. Generally speaking it is a strictly male

                        Masqerades display on important ceremonies especially funerals and cleansing ceremonies and hail
                        from both the <em>Ngwerong</em> and <em>Ngiri</em> sanctums.

                        A rearcher <em> Noela Kinyuy Banla</em> in an article titled <em>Nso’ traditional religion and
                            climate forecast: a critical photographic analysis</em> in <em>The British Academy Journal
                            2024</em> states: The Nso’ society is established in several orders that shape every
                        activity.
                        Traditional religion is one of the established orders which acted and continues to act as a
                        knowledge system through which
                        events are examined and carried out. Religious custodians/priests use this indigenous knowledge
                        in
                        climate
                        monitoring. In this light, ancestors or gods are consulted through ritual sacrifice to forecast
                        future and present events beyond the physical. As priests of traditional religion, the Fons
                        <em>the
                            head of
                            traditional government and religious authority in Nso’</em> and the Nwerong <em>an important
                            sacred society which performs legislative and judicial functions as well as rituals for
                            ecological issues</em>
                        act as

                        lead
                        in this activity of appeasing the ancestors and seeking solutions from them. This is because he
                        is
                        the
                        head of the traditional government in charge of consulting the gods of the land. He is regarded
                        as
                        the
                        paramount Fon because there are auxiliary Fons in Nso’ who pay allegiance to him.
